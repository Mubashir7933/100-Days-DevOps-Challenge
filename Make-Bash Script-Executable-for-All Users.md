## üß† What I Learned

- How Linux handles file permissions (`r`, `w`, `x`)
- The difference between symbolic (`+x`) and numeric (`chmod 755`) permission modes
- Why a script needs execute permissions to be runnable
- How to safely make a script executable for all users

## üîç Problem

The script `xfusioncorp.sh` was copied to `/tmp` but was missing executable permissions.

Initial permissions were:

```bash
---------- 1 root root 40 Aug 6 18:12 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution

Use the following command to give read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, and read + execute to group and others:

```bash
sudo chmod 755 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
```
