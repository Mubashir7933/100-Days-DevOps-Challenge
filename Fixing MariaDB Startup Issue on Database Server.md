## üîç Task

MariaDB service was down on the Stratos Datacenter database server, causing the Nautilus application to lose database connectivity. The goal was to investigate and bring the service back online.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Observed

When checking the service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

It showed:
```text
MariaDB server is down
Can't create/write to file '/run/mariadb/mariadb.pid' (Errcode: 13 "Permission denied")
```

---

## üß† Root Cause (What I Learned)

- The MariaDB process was **unable to create its PID file** because it couldn't write to the directory `/run/mariadb/`
- This directory lives in **volatile memory** and is deleted after a system reboot
- If not recreated on boot, MariaDB will **fail to start**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Steps

### Step 1: Recreate the `/run/mariadb/` directory

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /run/mariadb
```

### Step 2: Set the correct ownership so MariaDB can access it

```bash
sudo chown mysql:mysql /run/mariadb
```

### Step 3: Start the service again

```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```

### Step 4: Enable the service at boot (optional)

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

Check service status again:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

Expected output:

```text
Active: active (running)
```

|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PID file                         | A file that stores the process ID (PID) of a running service               |
| `/run` directory                 | Temporary filesystem (tmpfs) that resets on each reboot                   |
| `chown`                          | Linux command to change file/folder ownership                             |
| `systemctl`                      | Tool to manage system services (start, stop, status, etc.)                |
| Importance of SELinux/permissions| MariaDB must have permission to write where it expects (e.g., `/run`)     |

## üí° Pro Tip

To automate this fix after every reboot, you can create a systemd override or custom script in `/etc/tmpfiles.d/mariadb.conf`:

```bash
# /etc/tmpfiles.d/mariadb.conf
d /run/mariadb 0755 mysql mysql
```

This ensures `/run/mariadb` is created **automatically on every boot**.
